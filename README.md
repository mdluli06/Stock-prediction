# Stock-prediction

Thia is a project my team and I worked on aimed to assess the performance of different machine learning and statistical models in 
predicting stock prices. The selected models, LSTM, RF, ANN, and ARIMA, represent a spectrum of 
approaches, from deep learning to traditional time series analysis. This research sought to provide 
insights into which model performs best in different scenarios and stock markets.
